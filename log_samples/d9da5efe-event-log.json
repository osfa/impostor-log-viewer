The flooring in the room is not fully visible, but it seems to be a light-colored wooden plank type of flooring.\n\nThe style of the image is a real-life photograph with some visual distortion applied, giving it a slightly stretched appearance as if the photo was taken through a fisheye lens or a similar wide-angle effect.
